* Description
  This is a package where I will include configurations useful to
  produce a Jekyll site suitable for a math course, having =org= files
  as source.
* Idea
  All files relevant to the course are kept in a folder. There are two
  special subfolders: =clases= and =inicio=. In the folder =clases=
  there is a presentation file for each class, in =org= format. One
  also includes there image files, but generated inside the org file
  or standalone pictures. The name =options.org= is special, and it is
  recommended to be used for Beamer configurations common to all
  presentations, so that each presentation file includes it.

  The folder =inicio= contains =org= files that will correspond to
  pages in the site.

  When running =org-publish=, each =org= file will be converted to a
  beamer presentation and moved to the =pdfs= subdirectory of the
  jekyll project, and also converted to =html= format and included in
  the =_posts= subdirectory. Images files inside =clases= are moved to
  the subfolder =images= of the jekyll project.
* Usage
  The user should customize the variables
  =org-jekyll-html-base-source-directory= and
  =org-jekyll-html-base-jekyll-directory=. After that, include
  something like: =(org-jekyll-html-add-project '("algoritmos"
  "2017cAlgoritmosLIMA"))= in their init file, to add the project to
  =org-publish-project-alist=.
* Todo
  - Define also a backend, derived from beamer, for now with the only
    purpose of deleting the tags that become title of a section
    intended to have no title.
